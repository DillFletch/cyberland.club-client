# Cyberland Python Client

This client was written originally for https://cyberland.club, but eventually that died, so it is now still being developed for all of the forks and re-writes

## Dependencies
This program depends on:

* Python 3
* Python 3 Requests
* Python 3 json

To install these dependencies: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

I would recommend making a python3 virtual environment before you install the dependencies:

`python3 -m venv venv`

and to activate the virtual environment:

`source venv/bin/activate`

Make sure you activate the virtual envirnment every time before you run the program, if it is not activated already.

## Usage
`python3 client.py url`

url must be a valid URL. 

Defaults to https://cyberland.digital
